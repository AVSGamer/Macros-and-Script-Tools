# Macros-and-Script-Tools
Some of my macros and scripts for various PC operations.

Some are just modified versions of publicly available scripts.                                                                                          <br>
Maybe I'll upload an original working script someday when the need arises.

Filelist:                       <br>
LeftJoystick2Mouse.ahk          <br>- Modified version of the AutoHotkey Script for turning a joystick into a mouse interface.                          <br>
OnBStacksExit.ps1               <br>- Powershell script to terminate an ahk file that is launched automatically on BStacks Launch.                      <br>
OnOBSExit.ps1                   <br>- Script to change my Second Monitor's Wallpaper upon OBS termination.                                              <br>
OnOBSLaunch.ps1                 <br>- Script to change my Second Monitor's Wallpaper upon OBS launch.                                                   <br>
README.md                       <br>- This file you are reading right now.                                                                              <br>

Powershell scripts are auto-run by PC events through Window's Task Scheduler.                                                                           <br>
".ahk" files do not need a powershell script to be automatically launched on Task Scheduler's trigger.
