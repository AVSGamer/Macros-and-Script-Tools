# Macros-and-Script-Tools
Some of my macros and scripts for various PC operations.

Some are just modified versions of publicly available scripts.
Maybe I'll upload an original working script someday when the need arises.

Filelist:
LeftJoystick2Mouse.ahk                  - Modified version of the AutoHotkey Script for turning a joystick into a mouse interface.
OnBStacksExit.ps1                       - Powershell script to terminate an ahk file that is launched automatically on BStacks Launch.
OnOBSExit.ps1                           - Script to change my Second Monitor's Wallpaper upon OBS termination.
OnOBSLaunch.ps1                         - Script to change my Second Monitor's Wallpaper upon OBS launch.
README.md                               - This file you are reading right now.

Powershell scripts are auto-run by PC events through Window's Task Scheduler.
".ahk" files do not need a powershell script to be automatically launched on Task Scheduler's trigger.
