# Macros-and-Script-Tools
Some of my macros and scripts for various PC operations.

Some are just modified versions of publicly available scripts.                                                                                          </br>
Maybe I'll upload an original working script someday when the need arises.

OnBStacksExit.ps1               </br>- Powershell script to terminate an ahk file that is launched automatically on BStacks Launch.

Powershell scripts are auto-run by PC events through Window's Task Scheduler.                                                                           </br>
".ahk" files do not need a powershell script to be automatically launched on Task Scheduler's trigger.
